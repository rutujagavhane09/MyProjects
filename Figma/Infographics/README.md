This is the **Infographics  Design** created in **Figma**. The main functionality of the Design is to provide information about Biomes with its types and characteristics in a fun and graphical manner.

**What is Figma ?**
**Figma is a powerful, web-based design tool primarily for creating user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX). It's popular among designers for its real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple people to simultaneously work on the same design project. Figma supports vector graphics, and prototyping, and has an intuitive interface, making it accessible for both beginners and professionals. It also integrates well with other tools and supports plugins to extend its functionality.**


**Steps to follow**
1. Download the figma file named **Infographics.fig** or else you can directly view the design by clicking on the below link:

And whenever a user clicks on the View Answer Button then it will be navigated to another page filled with graphics and animations about **what exactly biome means ?** with its types mentioned in brief and with one informative video about it. When user clicks on the buttons **Read More** inside the **Terrestrial and Aquatic Biomes** then their info will be mentioned with their types and characteristics in detail.
